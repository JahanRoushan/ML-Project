# Ship Movements Forecasting

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting ship movements using historical Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. The goal is to derive insights into vessel behavior and predict future movements, which can aid in **maritime logistics, operational planning, and traffic monitoring**.

The implementation covers the following key aspects:

- **Data Analysis:** Extracting meaningful insights from ship movement patterns.
- **Feature Engineering:** Calculating key performance indicators (KPIs) such as distance traveled, transit durations, and speed.
- **Time Series Forecasting:** Predicting future ship movements using machine learning techniques.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The project derives several essential metrics for each vessel:

1. **Daily Distance Traveled:** Calculating the total distance covered by each ship on a given day.
2. **Transit & Stationary Durations:** Determining how long a vessel is moving versus remaining stationary.
3. **Average Speed While Moving:** Analyzing the shipâ€™s speed when it is in motion.
4. **Course & Heading Analysis:** Understanding the directional patterns of vessel movement.

## Implementation Details
The project is implemented using **Python** and includes the following steps:

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- The dataset consists of ship movement records, including **identifier, latitude, longitude, timestamp, course, heading, and speed (in knots)**.
- The data is cleaned and structured to ensure accurate time-based calculations.

### 2. Data Visualization & Analysis
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib** are used to visualize ship movement trends, speed distributions, and daily travel patterns.
- Statistical summaries help understand variations in vessel behavior over time.

### 3. Feature Engineering
- Calculating distance traveled using **Haversine formula** based on latitude/longitude changes.
- Segmenting movement into transit and stationary phases based on speed thresholds.
- Extracting time-based features (e.g., daily trends, seasonal effects).

### 4. Forecasting Model
- A **time series forecasting model** - ExponentialSmoothing is implemented to predict future ship movements.
- The forecast provides insights into expected travel distances, which can help optimize maritime operations.
- Models such as **ARIMA, LSTM, or XGBoost** may be used depending on the dataset characteristics.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for visualization)
- **Time Series Models** (ARIMA, LSTM, or XGBoost for prediction)

## Use Cases
- **Maritime Logistics:** Optimizing fuel consumption and route planning.
- **Port Management:** Predicting vessel arrivals and scheduling operations.
- **Environmental Monitoring:** Tracking shipping patterns to assess ecological impacts.

## Conclusion
This project provides a **data-driven approach** to analyzing and forecasting ship movements, offering valuable insights for the maritime industry. The combination of **historical data analysis and predictive modeling** enables improved decision-making and operational efficiency.
